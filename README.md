# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.  Summarist allows users to view a selection of books, save them in a library, and both view and listen to a summary of their contents.  Users that subscribe to a premium plan gain a larger selection of books.  Both books that are favorited manually and listened to in full will be added to a user's library.  

To run this application:
```
npm run dev
```

This app was built using Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Neon), Tailwind, Clerkjs, Stripe, and tRPC.
